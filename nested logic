Your local library needs your help! Given the expected and actual return dates for a library book, create a program that calculates the fine (if any). The fee structure is as follows:

If the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will be charged (i.e.: fine = 0).
If the book is returned after the expected return day but still within the same calendar month and year as the expected return date, 
fine = 15  *(the number of days late).
If the book is returned after the expected return month but still within the same calendar year as the expected return date, the fine = 500 * (the number of month late).
If the book is returned after the calendar year in which it was expected, there is a fixed fine of 1000.
Example
dd1 mm1 yy1(date month year) returned date
dd2 mm2 yy2 due date

The book is returned on time, so no fine is applied.

dd1 mm1 yy1(date month year) returned date
dd2 mm2 yy2 due date

The book is returned in the following year, so the fine is a fixed 10000.

sample input : 
9 6 2015    day = 9, month = 6, year = 2015 (date returned)
6 6 2015    day = 6, month = 6, year = 2015 (date due)
